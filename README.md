# Mapping Covid Across the United States in 2020

### Introduction
For this project I created two distinct thematic maps by integrating data on COVID-19 cases and rates into interactive and informative visualizations. By leveraging GIS techniques, I was able to create a visualization of how the pandemic has affected various communities within the United States. Both of these maps also feature a unique interactive element that aids the viewer into diving deeper into the story of Covid-19 in the US.

The first map that I created is a choropleth map of the covid-19 rates across the United States. This map colors each county based on the Covid-19 case rate per 1000 people in each county. This map also features a hover feature that allows you to hover over a county and tell you the county name and the case rate for that specific county. Looking at this map, we can see that the midwest has the highest rates of covid cases per 1000 people. Overall, this map allows the viewer to get a genral view of the dispersion of Covid across the United States, and allows for deeper exploration with the hover feature.

The second map that I created is a proportion symobols of the total number of covid-19 cases across the United States in 2020. This map groups counties based on the number of Covid-19 cases that were recorded in 2020. The counties that have more recorded covid cases have a bigger radius and a darker red color, helping visualzie the theme of the map. In order to provided greater depth, you are able to click on the dots to reveal the county name and the number of covid cases that were recorded for that particular county.


### Data Source
The COVID-19 case/death data utilized in this project originate from The New York Times and cover the entirety of 2020. These data are complemented by population statistics sourced from the 2018 ACS 5-year estimates at the county level. Additionally, the U.S. county boundary shapefile, essential for spatial analysis, was obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau.
